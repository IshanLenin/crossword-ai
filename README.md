# üìò Crossword Generator (CS50 AI)

This is a **Crossword Puzzle Generator** built as part of [Harvard's CS50 AI course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/), specifically the **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)** module.

It uses AI techniques like:
- **Backtracking Search**
- **Arc Consistency (AC-3)**
- **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)**
- **Degree Heuristic**
- **Least Constraining Value (LCV)**

The program reads a crossword structure and a list of words, then uses CSP algorithms to fill the crossword correctly ‚Äî finally rendering the puzzle as a `.png` image using Pillow.
